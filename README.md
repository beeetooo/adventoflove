# Advent Of Love
Advent of love is an excelent opportunity to practice [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/) from Python, PostgreSQL and React.js.
A quick start to React.js, at least for me, was this [repo](https://github.com/ruanyf/react-demos)
##Set up into Advent of Love
Before everything else, it's suggested to have a [Virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to mantain a dependencies isolation

1. Install pip:
   ```
   $ sudo apt-get -y install python-pip
   ```
2. Install the dependencies from this project:
   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. You'll also need to install postgresql
   ```
   $ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
   ```

I hope the code is as straight as possible to avoid reading problems

All the pendings (at least I think so) are in the trello board.
